To replace the boot media, you must remove the impaired controller module, install the replacement boot media, and transfer the boot image to a USB flash drive.

== Step 1: Remove the controller module

To access components inside the controller, you must first remove the controller module from the system and then remove the cover on the controller module.

. If you are not already grounded, properly ground yourself.
. Loosen the hook and loop strap binding the cables to the cable management device, and then unplug the system cables and SFPs (if needed) from the controller module, keeping track of where the cables were connected.

. Squeeze the latch on the cam handle until it releases, open the cam handle fully to release the controller module from the midplane, and then, using two hands, pull the controller module out of the chassis.

. Turn the controller module over and place it on a flat, stable surface.
. Open the cover by pressing the blue buttons on the sides of the controller module to release the cover, and then rotate the cover up and off of the controller module.

.Steps

. If you are not already grounded, properly ground yourself.
. Remove the mezzanine card using the following illustration or the FRU map on the controller module:
.. Remove the mezzanine card bezel by sliding it straight out from thr controller module.
.. Loosen the thumbscrews on the mezzanine card.  
+

NOTE: You can loosen the thumbscrews with your fingers or a screwdriver. If you use your fingers, you might need to rotate the NV battery up for better finger purchase on the thumbscrew next to it.

+
.. Lift the mezzanine card straight up.  

. Replace the boot media: 
.. Press the blue button on the boot media housing to release the boot media from its housing, rotate the boot media up, and then gently pull it straight out of the boot media socket.
+
NOTE: Do not twist or pull the boot media straight up, because this could damage the socket or the boot media.

.. Align the edges of the replacement boot media with the boot media socket, and then gently push it into the socket.
Check the boot media to make sure that it is seated squarely and completely in the socket, and if necessary, remove the boot media and reseat it into the socket.

.. Push the blue locking button, rotate the boot media all the way down, and then release the locking button to lock the boot media in place.
. Reinstall the mezzanine card: 
.. Align the socket on the motherboard with the socket on the mezzanine card, and then gently seat the card in the socket.
.. Tighten the three thumbscrews on the mezzanine card.
.. Reinstall the mezzanine bezel.
. Reinstall the controller module cover and lock it into place.

== Step 3: Transfer the boot image to the boot media

Install the system image on the replacement boot media using a USB flash drive with the image installed on it. You must restore the var file system during this procedure.

.Before you begin
* You must have a USB flash drive, formatted to MBR/FAT32, with at least 4GB capacity.
* You must have a network connection.

.Steps
. Download the appropriate image version of ONTAP to the formatted USB flash drive:
.. Use https://kb.netapp.com/onprem/ontap/dm/Encryption/How_to_determine_if_the_running_ONTAP_version_supports_NetApp_Volume_Encryption_(NVE)[How to determine if the running ONTAP version supports NetApp Volume Encryption (NVE)^] to determine if volume encryption is currently supported.
** If NVE is supported on the cluster, download the image with NetApp Volume Encryption.
** If NVE is not supported on the cluster, download the image without NetApp Volume Encryption.
See https://kb.netapp.com/onprem/ontap/os/Which_ONTAP_image_should_I_download%3F_With_or_without_Volume_Encryption%3F[Which ONTAP image should I download? With or without Volume Encryption?^] for more details.
. Unzip the downloaded image.
+
NOTE: If you are extracting the contents using Windows, do not use WinZip to extract the netboot image. Use another extraction tool, such as 7-Zip or WinRAR.
+
There are two folders in the unzipped service image file:

  *** `boot`
  *** `efi`

 .. Copy the `efi` folder to the top directory on the USB flash drive.
+
The USB flash drive should have the efi folder and the same Service Image (BIOS) version of what the impaired controller is running.

 .. Remove the USB flash drive from your laptop.
. Install the controller module:
.. Align the end of the controller module with the opening in the chassis, and then gently push the controller module halfway into the system.
.. Recable the controller module.
+
When recabling, remember to reinstall the media converters (SFPs) if they were removed.

. Insert the USB flash drive into the USB slot on the controller module.
+
Make sure that you install the USB flash drive in the slot labeled for USB devices, and not in the USB console port.

. Push the controller module all the way into the system, making sure that the cam handle clears the USB flash drive, firmly push the cam handle to finish seating the controller module, push the cam handle to the closed position, and then tighten the thumbscrew.
+
The controller begins to boot as soon as it is completely installed into the chassis.

. Interrupt the boot process to stop at the LOADER prompt by pressing Ctrl-C when you see Starting AUTOBOOT press Ctrl-C to abort....
+
If you miss this message, press Ctrl-C, select the option to boot to Maintenance mode, and then halt the controller to boot to LOADER.

. For systems with one controller in the chassis, reconnect the power and turn on the power supplies.
+
The system begins to boot and stops at the LOADER prompt.

. Set your network connection type at the LOADER prompt:
 ** If you are configuring DHCP: `ifconfig e0a -auto`
+
NOTE: The target port you configure is the target port you use to communicate with the impaired controller from the healthy controller during var file system restore with a network connection. You can also use the e0M port in this command.

 ** If you are configuring manual connections: `ifconfig e0a -addr=filer_addr -mask=netmask -gw=gateway-dns=dns_addr-domain=dns_domain`
  *** filer_addr is the IP address of the storage system.
  *** netmask is the network mask of the management network that is connected to the HA partner.
  *** gateway is the gateway for the network.
  *** dns_addr is the IP address of a name server on your network.
  *** dns_domain is the Domain Name System (DNS) domain name.
+
If you use this optional parameter, you do not need a fully qualified domain name in the netboot server URL. You need only the server's host name.

+
NOTE: Other parameters might be necessary for your interface. You can enter `help ifconfig` at the firmware prompt for details.
