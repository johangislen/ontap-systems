This guide gives detailed step-by-step instructions for installing a typical NetApp system. Use this guide if you want more detailed installation instructions.

== Step 1: Prepare for installation

To install your FAS2800 system, you need to create an account on the NetApp Support Site, register your system, and get license keys. You also need to inventory the appropriate number and type of cables for your system and collect specific network information.

You need to have access to the https://hwu.netapp.com[NetApp Hardware Universe] for information about site requirements as well as additional information on your configured system. You might also want to have access to the http://mysupport.netapp.com/documentation/productlibrary/index.html?productID=62286[Release Notes for your version of ONTAP 9] for your version of ONTAP for more information about this system.

You need to provide the following at your site:

* Rack space for the storage system
* Phillips #2 screwdriver
* Additional networking cables to connect your system to your network switch and laptop or console with a Web browser
* A laptop or console with an RJ-45 connection and access to a Web browser

.Steps
. Unpack the contents of all boxes.
. Record the system serial number from the controllers.
+

. Set up your account:
.. Log in to your existing account or create an account.
.. Register your system through  https://mysupport.netapp.com/eservice/registerSNoAction.do?moduleName=RegisterMyProduct[NetApp Product Registration]
. Download and install https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/tools/tool-eula/activeiq-configadvisor[Config Advisor] on your laptop.

. Inventory and make a note of the number and types of cables you received.
+
The following table identifies the types of cables you might receive. If you receive a cable not listed in the table, see the https://hwu.netapp.com[NetApp Hardware Universe] to locate the cable and identify its use.

. Place the bezel on the front of the system.

== Step 3: Cable controllers to your network

Ccable the controllers to your network using the two-node switchless cluster method or using the cluster interconnect network method.

[role="tabbed-block"]
====

.Option 1: Cable a two-node switchless cluster
--

Cable your network connections and your cluster interconnect ports.

NOTE: You must have contacted your network administrator for information about connecting the system to the switches.

Be sure to check the illustration arrow for the proper cable connector pull-tab orientation.

image::../media/oie_cable_pull_tab_down.svg[width=320px]

NOTE: As you insert the connector, you should feel it click into place; if you do not feel it click, remove it, turn it around and try again.

.Steps
. You can use the graphic or the step-by step instructions to complete the cabling between the controllers and to the switches:

.Steps
. Cable and configure your laptop or console:
 .. Set the console port on the laptop or console to 115,200 baud with N-8-1.
+
NOTE: See your laptop or console's online help for how to configure the console port.

 .. Connect the console cable to the laptop or console, and connect the console port on the controller using the console cable that came with your system, and then cConnect the laptop or console to the switch on the management subnet.
+
image::../media/drw_2800_laptop_to_switch_to_controller_IEOPS-1084.svg[width=500px]
