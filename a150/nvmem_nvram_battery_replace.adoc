To replace an NVMEM battery in the system, you must remove the controller module from the system, open it, replace the battery, and close and replace the controller module.

All other components in the system must be functioning properly; if not, you must contact technical support.

== Step 1: Shut down the impaired controller

[.lead]
include::../_include/shutdown_most_frus.adoc[]

. If the system has only one controller module in the chassis, turn off the power supplies, and then unplug the impaired controller's power cords from the power source.

== Step 2: Remove controller module

[.lead]
To access components inside the controller, you must first remove the controller module from the system and then remove the cover on the controller module.

.Steps
. If you are not already grounded, properly ground yourself.
. Loosen the hook and loop strap binding the cables to the cable management device, and then unplug the system cables and SFPs (if needed) from the controller module, keeping track of where the cables were connected.
+
Leave the cables in the cable management device so that when you reinstall the cable management device, the cables are organized.

. Remove and set aside the cable management devices from the left and right sides of the controller module.

. Squeeze the latch on the cam handle until it releases, open the cam handle fully to release the controller module from the midplane, and then, using two hands, pull the controller module out of the chassis.

. Turn the controller module over and place it on a flat, stable surface.
. Open the cover by sliding in the blue tabs to release the cover, and then swing the cover up and open.

== Step 3: Replace the NVMEM battery

[.lead]
To replace the NVMEM battery in your system, you must remove the failed NVMEM battery from the system and replace it with a new NVMEM battery.

.Steps
. If you are not already grounded, properly ground yourself.
. Check the NVMEM LED:
 ** If your system is in an HA configuration, go to the next step.
 ** If your system is in a stand-alone configuration, cleanly shut down the controller module, and then check the NVRAM LED identified by the NV icon.
+

+
NOTE: The NVRAM LED blinks while destaging contents to the flash memory when you halt the system. After the destage is complete, the LED turns off.

  *** If power is lost without a clean shutdown, the NVMEM LED flashes until the destage is complete, and then the LED turns off.
  *** If the LED is on and power is on, unwritten data is stored on NVMEM.
+
This typically occurs during an uncontrolled shutdown after ONTAP has successfully booted.
. Locate the NVMEM battery in the controller module.

. Locate the battery plug and squeeze the clip on the face of the battery plug to release the plug from the socket, and then unplug the battery cable from the socket.
. Remove the battery from the controller module and set it aside.
. Remove the replacement battery from its package.
. Loop the battery cable around the cable channel on the side of the battery holder.
. Position the battery pack by aligning the battery holder key ribs to the "`V`" notches on the sheet metal side wall.
. Slide the battery pack down along the sheet metal side wall until the support tabs on the side wall hook into the slots on the battery pack, and the battery pack latch engages and clicks into the opening on the side wall.
. Plug the battery plug back into the controller module.

== Step 4: Reinstall the controller module

[.lead]
After you replace components in the controller module, reinstall it into the chassis.

.Steps
. If you are not already grounded, properly ground yourself.
. If you have not already done so, replace the cover on the controller module.
. Align the end of the controller module with the opening in the chassis, and then gently push the controller module halfway into the system.
+
NOTE: Do not completely insert the controller module in the chassis until instructed to do so.

. Recable the system, as needed.
+
If you removed the media converters (QSFPs or SFPs), remember to reinstall them if you are using fiber optic cables.

. Complete the reinstallation of the controller module:

The controller module begins to boot as soon as it is fully seated in the chassis.

 .. With the cam handle in the open position, firmly push the controller module in until it meets the midplane and is fully seated, and then close the cam handle to the locked position.

NOTE: Do not use excessive force when sliding the controller module into the chassis to avoid damaging the connectors.
