To complete the chassis replacement, you must complete specific tasks.

== Step 1: Verify and set the HA state of the chassis

You must verify the HA state of the chassis, and, if necessary, update the state to match your system configuration.

. In Maintenance mode, from either controller module, display the HA state of the local controller module and chassis: `ha-config show`
+
The HA state should be the same for all components.

. If the displayed system state for the chassis does not match your system configuration:
 .. Set the HA state for the chassis: `ha-config modify chassis _ha-state_`
+
The value for HA-state can be one of the following:

  *** ha
  *** non-ha

. Confirm that the setting has changed: `ha-config show`
. If you have not already done so, recable the rest of your system.

== Step 2: Bring up the system

. If you have not done so, plug the power cables back into the PSUs.
. Turn on the PSUs by toggling the rocker switched to *ON*, and wait for the controllers to power up completely.
. Check the front and the back of the chassis and controllers for any fault lights after power up. 
. Connect to the SP or BMC IP address of the nodes via SSH. This will be the same address used to shut down the nodes.
. Perform additional health checks as described in https://kb.netapp.com/onprem/ontap/os/How_to_perform_a_cluster_health_check_with_a_script_in_ONTAP[How_to_perform_a_cluster_health_check_with_a_script_in_ONTAP^]
. Turn AutoSupport back on (end the maintenance window message):
`system node autosupport invoke -node * -type all -message MAINT=end`

NOTE: As a best practice, you should do the following:

* Resolve any https://activeiq.netapp.com/[Active IQ Wellness Alerts and Risks^] (Active IQ will take time to process post-power up AutoSupports - expect a delay in results)
* Run https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/tools/tool-eula/activeiq-configadvisor[Active IQ Config Advisor^]
* Check system health using https://kb.netapp.com/onprem/ontap/os/How_to_perform_a_cluster_health_check_with_a_script_in_ONTAP[How_to_perform_a_cluster_health_check_with_a_script_in_ONTAP^]

== Step 3: Return the failed part to NetApp
